# Simple linear regression(SLR) - cli
Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables:

 - One variable, denoted x, is regarded as the predictor, explanatory, or independent variable.
 - The other variable, denoted y, is regarded as the response, outcome, or dependent variable.

The equation that describes how y is related to x is known as the regression model.

The simple linear regression model is represented by:
>y = β0 + β1x + ε

# Installation

```sh
cd slr
install.sh
```

# Execution
